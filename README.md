# Sentiment_Analysis_of_2019_Canada_Election_Tweets

Individual project from course "Data Science and Analytics". The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted in 2019 Canadian elections - and answer the research question: “What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the 2019 Canadian elections.
